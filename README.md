# ðŸ“Š Financial Econometrics Modeling

## Overview
This project focuses on **computing financial econometrics models** using Python. It covers various methods used in **quantitative finance**, including:

- **G(ARCH) Models** (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
- **Markov Switching Models** (Regime-Switching Econometrics)
- **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** (Risk-Return Optimization)
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** (Dimensionality Reduction for Financial Data)

The goal is to provide a **toolbox for financial time series analysis, volatility modeling, and portfolio optimization**, making it useful for both **academic research and real-world financial applications**.

## ðŸ“Œ **Implemented Models**
### ðŸ”¹ **G(ARCH) Models**
- Used to model **volatility clustering** in financial markets.
- Implements **ARCH, GARCH(1,1), GJR-GARCH, and EGARCH models** for better volatility estimation.

### ðŸ”¹ **Markov Switching Models**
- Captures **regime changes** in financial markets.
- Useful for modeling periods of **high and low volatility** or **bull and bear markets**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**
- Implements **mean-variance optimization** for asset allocation.
- Computes the **efficient frontier** and helps in **optimal portfolio construction**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Reduces **dimensionality** in financial data.
- Extracts key **latent factors** driving asset returns.
